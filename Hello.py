    and makes edit to the response only if you think the response needs to be edited due to logical or contradicting mistakes

    1. First read the question stated below and understand it.
    2. Read the response below. This response acts as the answer to the question. However this response may be semantically
    or logically incorrect in response.
    3. The response usually will have 2 parts, the first part will be the answer and the second part will have the context 
    or information or reasoning from which the answer was stated.
    4. If the answer and the reason are not in alignment, reformulate the response and send the correct response again


    Here are few examples for you to understand - 

    Question: I have Cochlear Implant series and want to swim to 30 meters, will this harm my device? 

    Response: No, the Cochlear Implant series are validated to withstand pressure up to 40m under water for the 
    purposes of swimming, which is equivalent to 4 atm nominal pressure and 6 atm test pressure. Therefore, swimming to 
    30 meters will not cause any harm to your device.
    
    Reformulated/Revised Response: No, the Cochlear Implant series are validated to withstand pressure up to 40m under water for the 
    purposes of swimming, which is equivalent to 4 atm nominal pressure and 6 atm test pressure. Therefore, swimming to 
    30 meters will not cause any harm to your device.
    
    Reason: In the Response, it clearly says that the device can withstand upto 40m and in the Question, the question asked is
    can it go to 30m and will it harm the device. Since it doesn't harm the device, the answer should be "No" followed by the 
    same text that's in Response. Hence this is not having contradicting response, hence the same Response has been replied back
    as Revised Response without changing anything
    
    Question: I have Cochlear Implant series and want to swim to 50 meters, will this harm my device? 

    Response: No, the Cochlear Implant series are not designed to withstand pressure at depths greater than 40m 
    for swimming. Therefore, swimming to a depth of 50m would exceed the recommended pressure and could cause damage 
    to the implant.
    
    Reformulated/Revised Response: Yes, the Cochlear Implant series are not designed to withstand pressure at depths greater than 
    40m for swimming. Therefore, swimming to a depth of 50m would exceed the recommended pressure and could cause damage 
    to the implant.
    
    Reason: The Question clearly asked if it will harm the device when a person goes swimming to 50m, the Response says that
    it will harm the device if it goes beyond 40m. But it has "No" and this is contradicting to the question asked. Hence
    "No" has been changed to "Yes" and the rest of the reason is never changed. The reason should never be changed and only the
    response such as "yes"/"no" can be changed based on the question asked.
    
    From the above 2 examples, understand the context of the question and understand the response and understand how the 
    revised response has been changed or kept the same throught the reason. The reason is for you to understand logically how
    you need to respond back.
    
    Remember, "Response" is the source truth and you need to only believe it and not bring any other external sources. You need
    to only change the "Yes/No" part of the question and not change anything else. This is very important
    
    
    Be precise and accurate and be logical in answering. 
    
    While formulating it be accurate and logical. Do not give contradicting answers. 

    The response should be the only facts you will look out for and not any other external
    facts. While formulating the response read the question again and answer accordingly to avoid contradicting replies

    Reply with the reformulated response.

    Just send the response, do not prefix with anything like "Response :" or "Revised Response :"

    Question: {Question}
    
    Response: {Response}
    
    Reformulated/Revised Response: Your Revised Response
